Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We welcome contributions from everyone, whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting out. This page provides all the information you need to get involved.

## Project Overview

Our project is split into two separate repositories. Depending on the issue you have or the feature you want to contribute, you need to use either the one or the other:

- [refarch-templates][repo-link]: Provides starter files for creating a new project
- [refarch](https://github.com/it-at-m/refarch): Provides ready to use components (like API Gateway), integrations, libraries and other tools

### Milestones

Milestones help us track the progress of our project and set goals for upcoming releases. Because we currently split our work into two repositories, we also have a separate overview of the milestones.

- [refarch-templates milestones][milestone-link]
- [refarch milestones](https://github.com/it-at-m/refarch/milestones)

::: info Information
We try to keep the milestones in sync in terms of naming and fulfillment date as best as possible.

### Project Boards

Our project boards provide a visual representation of the tasks and issues we are working on. You can check the status of ongoing work and see what you can help with.
Just like with the milestones, we also have two separate project boards.
