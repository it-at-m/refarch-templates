# Organize

The following explains current used pracitcies and recommandation on
organizing your projects in github.

## Issue Templates

Issue templates are essential for the project,
streamlining the process of reporting bugs,
requesting features, or providing feedback.
They guide contributors in sharing relevant
information, ensuring clarity and improving
communication. Using these templates enhances
collaboration and creates a more efficient
development process

Currently there are four different types of Issue Templates, that can be used.
You can finde the code for the Templates inside the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder.
If needed you can extend or remove any. Out of the Box, issues created with one of the templates
will automaticially get labled. 

### Bug Report

Report a bug to help the project improve.

### Feature request

Suggest an idea or possible new feature for this project.

### Maintenance work

### Documentation change

## Github Projects

For the Refarch,
currently [github Projects](https://docs.github.com/de/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)

project managment and dont have a lot of stackeholders. If you have a bigger projects with more Stackholders
we recommand using more comprehensive solutions like jira.

## CODE OF CONDUCT

The Code of Conduct is a crucial part of our project's
documentation that outlines expected behaviors to ensure

safe and valued. By adhering to this Code, we enhance our
collective efforts and encourage diverse perspectives.

The license included in our GitHub project is a
legal document that defines how the project's code

clarifies the rights and responsibilities of both
contributors and users, promoting transparency
and encouraging collaboration. By specifying
usage terms, the license protects the authors'
intellectual property while fostering an
open-source culture, ensuring that everyone
understands how to engage with the project
responsibly.

As default, all LHM Projects are licensed under MIT
